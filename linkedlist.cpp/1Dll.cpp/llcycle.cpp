//method 1
//store the nodes in a hashmap and check if the node is already present in the hashmap.
/*unordered_map<ListNode*, int> nodemap;
This hashmap stores the memory addresses (pointers) of nodes, not their values.
Even if two nodes have the same value, their addresses in memory are different.*/

// Example
// Consider these nodes in memory:

// Node Position	Value	Memory Address (Example)
// 1 (head)	3	0x100
// 2	3	0x200
// 3	2	0x300
// 4	1	0x400
// 5	2	0x500
// 6	4	0x600
// 7 (Cycle to Node 3)	2	0x300
// When we check nodemap.find(mover), we are checking if a nodeâ€™s memory address is already in the hashmap.
// Since 0x100 and 0x200 are different, both will be added separately.

//if there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.
//eg: in cycle if the distance between fast and slow pointer is k nodes
//fast moves 2 nodes and slow moves 1 node
//so in next step, the distance decreases by 1
//in next step, the distance decreases by 1
//and at point the distance becomes 0 and they meet.
//since distance % 1 = 0, they will meet at some point.



//if there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the linked list.
