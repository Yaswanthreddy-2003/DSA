//to initialise an empty vector
//vector<int>a or vector<int>a{} or vector<int>a(0);

//2d empty vector
//vector<vector<int>>a or vector<vector<int>>a{} or vector<vector<int>>a(0,vector<int>(0));

//capacity of vector
//what is the capacity of vector?
//capacity of vector is the number of elements that can be stored in the vector without reallocation.
//what is reallocation?
//reallocation is the process of allocating new memory for the vector and copying the elements from the old memory to the new memory.
//when we add elements or push_back elements to the vector, if the capacity of the vector is not enough to store the new elements, 
//then the vector will reallocate the memory and copy the elements from the old memory to the new memory.

//the capacity of the vector is always greater than or equal to the size of the vector.
//the capacity of the vector is always a power of 2.
